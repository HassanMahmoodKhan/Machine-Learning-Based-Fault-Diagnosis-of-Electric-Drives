#Machine Learning Based Fault Diagnosis of Electric Drives

The project presents a time-based analysis of some critical and non-critical faults i.e., electrical and mechanical, using statistical feature extraction techniques to extract 
information rich regions from the motor output data. This is followed by Machine Learning based multi-class classification to optimally identify various faults with 
high accuracy and short diagnosis time for appropriate corrective action. The classification accuracy is further enhanced using data validation and algorithm optimization
techniques. The methodology was tested on validated VFD simulation model created on Simulink, MATLAB at various loading conditions. The results obtained showed high 
correct classification accuracy in comparison to other diagnosis techniques and an in-house comparison between multiple machine learning algorithms was conducted to 
identify the most optimal results.

The project has enabled a comprehensive study of the use of AI & ML in the field of motor conditioning and response generation. Since the use of ML in this particular 
field is relatively new, there exists a plethora of opportunities, one of which we have tried to explore during the course of our project. Moreover, thinking on the 
lines of novelty, we reviewed multiple supervised classification algorithms to gauge results in a more complete manner. All in all, we were able to generate a robust 
and considerably accurate methodology for fault diagnosis of AC electric drives being employed in the industry and elsewhere.
